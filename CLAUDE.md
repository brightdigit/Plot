# CLAUDE.md — Plot

Vendored package in the BrightDigit Publish stack (`Packages/Publish/Plot`),
maintained in-tree on plain Swift 6.4 (`// swift-tools-version:6.4`), macOS 15+.

- Strict concurrency is mandatory. Resolve every diagnostic properly
  (Sendable / isolation / `Synchronization.Mutex`); never use
  `@unchecked Sendable` — a SwiftLint `no_unchecked_sendable` rule enforces this.
- Lint: `LINT_MODE=STRICT ./Scripts/lint.sh` — full BrightDigit house style
  (swift-format + SwiftLint + build) gates; periphery is local-only (skipped
  when `$CI` is set).
- Tests use XCTest (kept as-is).

## Memory & Corrections Convention

`.claude/agent-notes.md` is the canonical, versioned corrections log for this repository — an
append-only record of the maintainer's corrections and standing **always/never** directives.

- **Read `.claude/agent-notes.md` at the start of every work session, before doing any work.** It
  is the source of truth for *how* to work in this repo.
- **Whenever the maintainer makes a correction or gives an always/never instruction, append one
  line to `.claude/agent-notes.md` proactively (without being asked).** One line per directive,
  newest at the bottom. If a directive supersedes an earlier one, update or remove the stale line
  rather than leaving both.
